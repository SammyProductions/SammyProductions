        <p style="color: #000000;">Hello! I'm Sammy Productions. I'm an experimental Garageband music producer. Back in December, I started to make GarageBand music. I didn't particulary have a reason why, but because I was having fun, I kept going on with it. I am an avid lover of all genres of music. Every time I make music, it's like I improve in some way. I'm a very trial-and-error type person. If you are willing to collaborate with me, my Discord is aha.3101. You, person who is reading right now, should share this website with people you know so I can gain an audience for my music. It will be greatly appreciated.</p>
